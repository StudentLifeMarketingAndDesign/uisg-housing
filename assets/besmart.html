<h2>RED WATCH BAND PROGRAM</h2>

<p>…Every second counts.</p>

<p>The Red Watch Band Program is in its third year at the University of Iowa.  The training program focuses on knowledge, skill, and confidence building to prevent death from alcohol overdose.</p>

<p>All students who complete the training will receive CPR and alcohol bystander training, a red watch, and will be better able to link the impact that alcohol has on the body.</p>

<h3>Why we care:</h3>

<p>The UISG Wingman Campaign believes in being prepared for any situation, and arming yourself skills that could help save your life, or the life of a friend.  The Red Watch Band Program has already trained over 1,200 students at the University of Iowa, and will continue to teach students to “make the call.”</p>

<h3>SIGNS OF ALCOHOL OVERDOSE:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Passed out or semi-conscious and cannot be awakened.</li>
<li>Vomits while sleeping/passed out and does not wake up.</li>
 

<li>Slow or irregular breathing (fewer than 8 breaths/minute).</li>
<li>Cold, clammy, pale or bluish skin color.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you see any of these signs in a friend</p>

<h2>CALL 911 immediately!</h2>

<ul>
<li>Perform CPR (if certified)</li>
<li>Stay with the friend until help arrives</li>
<li>Gather information about the amount of alcohol consumed (if possible)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not CPR certified?</p>
