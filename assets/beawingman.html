<h2>RESPONSIBLE  ACTION PROTOCOL</h2>

<p>Isn’t it worth making the call to save a life?  Under the UI Student Code of Conduct, Responsible Action Protocol, students are protected:</p>

<p>“A student who calls for or seeks emergency  assistance on his/her own behalf or on the behalf of a student experiencing an alcohol or other drug related emergency <em>will not</em>, in most cases, be subject to status sanctions such as disciplinary probation or suspension under the Code of Student Life. </p>

<p>However, the Dean of Student may require completion of alcohol and/or other drug education/counseling.  The dean may also notify the student’s parents of the alcohol or drug violation.”</p>
